# Port Card BERT TAP0 Scan Instructions (2024)

For the port card BERT TAP0 scans, we use an RD53B SCC (CROCv1) with optical readout, an optical FMC, and a port card.
To test Type 5K e-links, there is a custom red adapter board (with jumpers) that is used to connect a display port (DP) cable on one side and the 15-pin paddle board of the e-link on the other side.

## TODO
- Add pictures of Type 5K e-link setup.
- Document jumper settings.
- Document setup commands.
- Add links to TrackerDAQ and Ph2_ACF repositories.
- Document terminals: two on kucms (login and edit), and one locally (copy)

## DONE
